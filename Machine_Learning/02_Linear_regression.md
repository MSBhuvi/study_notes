# Linear Regression In Machine Learning

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input and output, meaning the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes. This relationship is represented by a straight line.

algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features.

It finds the best-fitting straight line that represents the relationship between input (X) and output (Y).

**Example:**
Predicting house price based on size.

As the size increases, the price increases — linear relationship.

**Independent variable (input)**

  **Dependent variable (output)**
