# Introduction

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets. It allows them to predict new, similar data without explicit programming for each task. Machine learning finds applications in diverse fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and automating tasks.

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Machine learning = teaching a computer to learn patterns from data and use those patterns to make decisions.

### Real-Life Examples:
When Netflix recommends movies → it learns from what you watched.

When Gmail filters spam → it learns from email patterns.

When your phone predicts the next word → it learns from your typing history.

Handles Massive Data: Machine learning works well with large data and finds patterns that humans might miss.
Adapts Dynamically: Systems evolve with new data, staying relevant in changing environments.
Drives Smarter Decisions: From predicting customer behavior to detecting fraud, ML enhances decision-making with data-driven insights.
Personalizes Experiences: Recommendation systems, like those on Netflix or Amazon, tailor suggestions to individual preferences.

## Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning.

Unsupervised Learning.

Reinforcement Learning.

### Supervised Learning.

The model learns from labeled data (data with answers).

The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

**Classification**

Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).

</p>

**Regression**

 Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).
