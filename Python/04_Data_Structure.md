# Python Data Structures
## Intoduction
Python provides a rich set of built-in and specialized data structures that allow efficient storage, retrieval, transformation, and organization of data.

## Built-in Data Structures
List

Tuples

sets

Dictionaries

### **List**:

A list in Python is a dynamic, mutable, ordered data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable.
It is one of the most commonly used data structures in Python because it is flexible, easy to use, and supports a wide variety of operations.

Python lists:

Can store mixed data types

Can grow or shrink dynamically

Are implemented internally as dynamic arrays (resizable arrays)

# Python List – Detailed Explanation

## 1. Introduction
A **list** in Python is a *dynamic, mutable, ordered data structure* used to store multiple items in a single variable.  
It is one of the most commonly used data structures in Python because it is flexible, easy to use, and supports a wide variety of operations.

Python lists:
- Can store **mixed data types**
- Can grow or shrink dynamically
- Are implemented internally as **dynamic arrays** (resizable arrays)

Lists are ideal when you need an ordered, modifiable sequence of elements.

## 2. Key Characteristics of Lists

### ✔ Ordered
Elements in a list maintain the order in which they are inserted.

```python
x = [10, 20, 30]
# index: 0   1   2
