# Trigger

In SQL, a TRIGGER is a database object that automatically executes (or “fires”) a predefined block of SQL code in response to a specific event on a table or view.

Triggers are commonly used to enforce business rules, maintain audit logs, and ensure data integrity without relying on application-level logic.


## What is a Trigger?

A trigger:

Is associated with a table or view

Executes automatically
