# VIEW

In SQL, a VIEW is a virtual table that is based on the result of a stored SELECT query. It does not store data physically (in most databases); instead, it dynamically fetches data from the underlying tables whenever the view is queried.

## Advantages of VIEWS

Security: Restrict access to sensitive columns

Simplicity: Hide complex SQL logic

Reusability: Use the same query multiple times

Consistency: Centralized business logic

## Disadvantages of VIEWS

Performance overhead for complex views

Limited support for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Dependency on base tables
